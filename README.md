This project analyzes a dataset related to diabetes. It includes:

- Data cleaning and preparation
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
- Forecasting diabetes outcome using various machine learning algorithms

## Organization and Exploratory Data Analysis

The dataset used for analysis contains the following columns:

- Pregnancies: Number of pregnancies
- Glucose: Blood glucose level
- BloodPressure: Blood pressure level
- SkinThickness: Skin thickness
- Insulin: Insulin level
- BMI: Body Mass Index (BMI)
- Age: Age of the patient
- Outcome: Diabetes outcome (0: No, 1: Yes)

The exploratory data analysis includes:

- Descriptive statistics
- Data visualization using various plots such as bar plots, scatter plots, and pair plots
- Data preprocessing including handling missing values and normalization

## Principal Component Analysis (PCA)

Principal Component Analysis (PCA) is performed to reduce the dimensionality of the dataset and visualize it in 2D. The variance explained by each principal component is also analyzed.

## Classifiers

Various machine learning classifiers are trained and tested on the dataset to predict diabetes outcomes.

### Gaussian Naive Bayes

Gaussian Naive Bayes classifier is trained and tested on the dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

### Categorical Naive Bayes

Categorical Naive Bayes classifier is trained and tested on the dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

### Decision Tree

A Decision Tree classifier is trained and tested on the dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

### Support Vector Machine (SVM)

A Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier is trained and tested on the dataset. Performance metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score are calculated.

## Conclusion

The performance of various classifiers is compared, and the best-performing model is identified.
